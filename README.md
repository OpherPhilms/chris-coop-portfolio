# Christopher Cooper Portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio site built with React and Vite to showcase a few of the projects I'm proud of in a way that is interactive and easy to browse. The site features smooth animations, responsive design, and a clean layout to highlight my work effectively (I hope).

## Features
